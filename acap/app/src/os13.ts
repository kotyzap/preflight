/**
 * Which products get AXIS OS 13 at all.
 *
 * This is the question the tool was silently getting wrong, and it is the most
 * consequential one it answers, because the two possible answers lead to
 * completely different money:
 *
 *   "needs application work"   → a morning of vendor emails
 *   "will never run AXIS OS 13" → a replacement quote
 *
 * Axis states plainly, in the AXIS OS lifecycle guide:
 *
 *     "AXIS OS 13 won't support Artpec-6 products."
 *
 * And in the same document's Y2038 section, under the heading
 * "Affected products (32-bit that will get AXIS OS 13)", it publishes the list
 * reproduced below — the 32-bit products that *do* get it, being ARTPEC-7 and
 * i.MX6SX. Both quotes: https://help.axis.com/en-us/axis-os
 *
 * Put together, for a camera reporting `armv7hf`:
 *
 *   on this list      → gets AXIS OS 13, and the Y2038 ABI break is a real
 *                       problem for its ACAPs. Rule A5.
 *   not on this list  → no published AXIS OS 13. Rule A9.
 *
 * WHY ABSENCE IS NOT ENOUGH ON ITS OWN. The list omits large ARTPEC-7 camera
 * families — the P1375 and P3245 among them — and ARTPEC-7 is not the generation
 * Axis says is unsupported. So "absent from the list" alone cannot mean "no
 * AXIS OS 13" without risking exactly the error this file must not make.
 *
 * The camera settles it, and better than any model table can: an ARTPEC-7
 * product has been offered AXIS OS 11 and 12, while an ARTPEC-6 product is
 * capped on the 10.12 LTS track. So a 32-bit camera absent from the list AND
 * still on AXIS OS 10 never received AXIS OS 11 either — that is a device on a
 * closed track, and the conclusion is firm. The same camera running 11.x or 12.x
 * is on the active track and its AXIS OS 13 status is simply not published; that
 * gets "unknown", not a replacement recommendation.
 *
 * Note this also means the chipset table's inability to tell ARTPEC-6 from
 * ARTPEC-7 stops mattering. The firmware the camera is actually running is a
 * better signal than the generation label, and it comes from the device.
 *
 * A CORRECTION WORTH RECORDING. Earlier in this project the M1137 was read as
 * proof that this list was incomplete — it reports armv7hf and is absent from
 * the list — and A5 was rewritten to use the architecture parameter instead. The
 * list was never incomplete. The M1137 is absent because it is ARTPEC-6 and is
 * not getting AXIS OS 13 at all. The list was answering a question the rule was
 * not asking.
 *
 * WHY THIS RULE HEDGES AND THE OTHERS DO NOT. Every other rule here errs toward
 * "unverified" because a false all-clear is the expensive mistake. This one is
 * the opposite: its false positive tells somebody to replace working hardware.
 * So it says "no published upgrade path" and names its source, rather than
 * "cannot be upgraded", and it tells the reader to confirm with Axis before
 * spending anything.
